					<h2>Semi-automated Offside Technology</h2>				
					<p>
						Semi-automated offside technology is a support tool for the video match officials and the on-field officials to help them make faster, more reproducible and more accurate offside decisions.
					</p>
					<p>
						The new technology uses 12 dedicated tracking cameras mounted underneath the roof of the stadium to track the ball and up to 29 data points of each individual player, 50 times per second, calculating their exact position on the pitch. The 29 collected data points include all limbs and extremities that are relevant for making offside calls.

					<h2>Video Assistant Referee (VAR)</h2>				
					<p>
						A video assistant referee (VAR) system is a support tool for officials. The use of video match officials (VMOs) in football was included in the 2018/2019 edition of the Laws of the Game and was successfully used at the 2018 FIFA World Cupâ„¢. Since then, the system has been implemented in over 100 competitions worldwide.
					</p>
					<p>
						The video assistant referee team supports the referee from a centralised video operation room (VOR) located in Doha, Qatar. All host broadcaster camera feeds from the eight stadiums are provided to the VOR through a fibre-optic network. The on-field referee at each stadium talks to the VAR team via a sophisticated fibre-linked radio system.

					<h2>Goal-line Technology</h2>				
					<p>
						Goal-line technology is a technical means of instantly determining whether the whole of the ball has crossed the goal line. Goal-line technology continues to be a staple in the football world since it was first implemented in 2014.
					</p>
					<p>
						The technology must provide a clearly indicate whether the ball has fully crossed the line. This information will serve to assist the referee in taking their final decision. The information is transmitted within one second which ensures an immediate response from the referee. Only the match officials are receive the signal on their watches. The system uses 14 high-speed cameras mounted on the catwalk of the stadium/under the roof. The data from the cameras is used to create a 3D animation to visualise the decision to the fans on TV and on the giant screen inside the stadium.
