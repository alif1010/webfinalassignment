					<h2>Football boots: the innovation of soccer in footwear</h2>	
					<p>
						The first pair of football boots noted in history are those made for King Henry VIII of England, who ordered a pair from his Great Wardrobe in 1526. Pre 1891 nothing was allowed to project out of the shoes worn by a footballer, a revision then lead to the use of small studs or bars and football boots were born.
					</p>

					<h2>What problem does this innovation solve?</h2>				
					<p>
						A high profile elite Premier League footballer will likely have both an employment contract and an image rights agreement with their club. As set out in more detail here, the player will usually be a shareholder in a company that will have the benefit of the player’s image rights to exploit. That company will enter into an agreement with the club to market the player’s image rights as well as with other commercial brand partners. As such, apart from the player’s employment contract, almost all other deals will be agreed between the player’s image rights company and a variety of commercial partners including the player’s boot manufacturer.

					<h2>4 Tips to Finding the Perfect Footwear for Your Football Needs</h2>				
					<p>
						It is important to find the most suitable boots for you hence, you may want to skip your neighbourhood shop if they only have limited varieties and a few brands available. Go to a bigger sports store to ensure you have the best selection for choosing. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It may seem really silly to even add this in, but some people make this mistake. Don't ever buy a pair of boots just because you think they look cool or because Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi endorses them. Buy them only if you feel comfortable in them. If it feels too tight, try the next pair of boots. Never sacrifice comfort over price or looks.

					<h2>Cristiano Ronaldo’s Football Boots</h2>				
					<p>
						CR7 is arguably one of the greatest players to ever grace a football pitch. Since being promoted to Sporting’s first team at the age of just 16 in 2002, Cristiano Ronaldo has consistently broken records, won trophies and scored a lot of goals (and we mean a lot). He even said himself, “I’ve already said that I don’t chase records, records chase me.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Cristiano has been wearing Nike boots for most of his career, including the 1998 match where he wore their Nike Mercurials around his neck in a move that was bound to gain popularity for the boot. He has been in partnership with Nike since 2003 and in 2016, he signed a lifetime endorsement deal with them for $1 billion.
